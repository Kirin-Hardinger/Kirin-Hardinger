Hey there! My name is Kirin Hardinger. I'm a student at the University of Nevada Reno in the computer science and engineering program, graduating in May of 2024.

I love video games and it's my goal to be a game developer as a full-time career. I particularly enjoy casual simulation/management games like Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper. There are some exceptions to this; I'm also a huge fan of Skyrim and DOOM. Personally, I'm only planning on developing casual indie games.

Currently, I'm still getting the basics down for programming in general. I'm focusing on getting a handle of C and C++ and covering best practices.
